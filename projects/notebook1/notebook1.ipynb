    "## Introduction \n",

    "\n",
    "### The notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is divided into six sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Visualization of the lysozyme structure](#1)\n",
    "2. [Visualization of the secondary structure propensities](#2)\n",
    "3. [Reading and visualizing CD heat denaturation data.](#3)\n",
    "4. [Thermodynamic properties from CD heat denaturation data](#4)\n",
    "5. [Deconvolution of CD heat denaturation data](#5)\n",
    "6. [Graphical exellence](#6)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two sections you will investigate the secondary structure of lysozyme by looking at [NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_of_proteins) and [X-ray crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography) structures. The next three sections deals with data from a heat denaturation CD measurement done on lysozyme. In the third section you will read in this dataset into the notebook and visualize it. In the fourth section you will investigate the thermodynamic properties of heat denatuation of lysozyme from the data. Specifically you will attempt to find the melting temperature of lysozyme ($T_m$) and obtain a full set of thermodynamic state functions ($\\Delta G^\\circ$, $\\Delta H^\\circ$, $\\Delta S^\\circ$) for the unfolding process. In the fifth section you will deconvolute the CD heat denaturation dataset to see how the the secondary structure propensities changes during unfolding. In the sixth and final section you should try to produce a publication ready figure. \n",

    "### Lysozyme\n",
    "[Lysozyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysozyme) is an enzymatic protein that is involed in breaking down cell walls of bacteria by hydrolyzing peptidoglycans. It is found in animals and is a part of the immune system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular Dichroism (CD)\n",
    "[Circular Dichroism (CD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dichroism) is a spectroscopic technique that  measures the difference in absorption of left- and right-handed circular polarized light from optically active samples. Optical activate samples are charaterized by possessing chiral or asymmetric molecules. For proteins, different secondary structural components such as [beta sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheet),  [alpha helices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix) and the absence of them, reffered to as [random coils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_coil), absorbs circular polarized light differently and this can be measured with CD. See **Figure 1** below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/cd_spectra.png\">\n",
    "<p><center><b>Figure 1:</b> An example of circular dichroism data highlighting the difference between pure alpha helical, beta-sheet and random coil proteins. </center></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorption of left- and right-handed circular polarized light can be written as $A_l$ and $A_r$ respectively. Thus the difference in absorption ($\\Delta A$) can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta A = A_l - A_r$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [Lambert–Beer law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer–Lambert_law) we thus have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta A = (\\epsilon_l - \\epsilon_r)cl$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where c is the molecule concentration, l the cuvette pathlength and $\\epsilon_l$ and $\\epsilon_r$ the molar extinction coefficients for left and rigth handed circular polarized light respectively. \n",
    " \n",
    "CD measurements are often given in units of molar circular dichroism ($\\Delta \\epsilon$) where: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta \\epsilon = (\\epsilon_l - \\epsilon_r)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta \\epsilon$ has the units $M^{-1}cm^{-1}$. Sometimes the CD measurement will be given in degrees of ellipticity ($\\theta$). It measures the ellipticity of the polarization of the outcoming ligth. $\\theta$ has the units of mdeg (millidegrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a conversion between $\\Delta \\epsilon$ and $\\theta$ given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta \\epsilon = \\theta \\times \\frac{0.1 \\times \\textit{MRW}}{P \\times \\text{C} \\times 32988}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where C is the concentration of the molecule being measured, P is the cuvette pathlength in cm, and MRW (Molecular Residue Weight) is the mean residue weight of the protein (total molecular weight of the protein divided by the number of residues).\n",

    "As the secondary structure propensities of a protein can be determined by crystallography and a DSSP analysis (as we have done previously in this Notebook), so can we determine the propensities by CD. This is called a _deconvolution_. It is not as accurate as the before mentioned method, but since CD is much less tedious than crystallography (a crystallographer can often spend months to years to get something that works) it can be preferrable to use a deconvolution to at least give a reasonable estimate of the propensities.  \n",

    "By now you should already know that different secondary structure yields different CD spectra. Using this information we can estimate the amount of secondary structure in our protein by fitting our experimental CD spectrum for lysozyme to 3 basis spectra each of which contains either pure $\\alpha$-helix, $\\beta$-strand or random coil. The idea is that the amount of each basis spectra that is contained in an experimental CD spectra determines the amount of secondary structure for that experimental spectra. Mathematically we can write that experimtal spectrum as a linear combination of the basis spectras as follows: \n",
